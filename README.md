# Sugaroids_Improved

I started improving this project just for fun.
But today (2025/08/13) I realized that displaying it on GitHub and showing it to people can help improve the mechanics of the game and the structure of my code.
I also see it as an opportunity to show how I’ve been improving over these months (or at least I hope so XD), since I first created and showed the first version of this project.

This is a very simple Brief I made when I took the subject "2D Art Workshop for Video Games" in August of last year.

All the sprites/textures used in this project were 100% generated by AI. I will love to change it with illustrations made by artists.
So, if you or someone you know would like to contribute with some art, feel more than free to contact me, I will be more than happy. 
(Of course you will be properly credited inside the project with your name/username and a link of your preference to your work/social media).

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project/s. I hope you’re enjoying it/or did enjoy it!

Kapnack.
